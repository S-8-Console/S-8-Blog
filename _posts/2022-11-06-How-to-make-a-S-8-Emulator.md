## Foreword

Hello there! Welcome to this guide about making your own S-8-Emulator, I expect you to have some knowledge about Rust to be able to follow this tutorial. After all, this is a tutorial on how to make a S-8 emulator, and not a "how to program" tutorial.

I also expect you to have some basic knowledge about hexadecimal notation and binary arithmetic logic like binary and.

I also want to say that I'm always open to improving my blogs. If you got any suggestions please contact me on discord: Stan xD#7662

## What is S-8?

S-8 is a fantasy console, which means that it is a computer that doesn't exist physically (at least as of yet) and for now will only be emulated.

S-8 is designed to be easily emulatable and simple, it's an excellent choice for your first project to work on if you want to learn emulation!

It's an 8 bit computer that is well documented and fully open-source, licensed under the GPL-3.0 license which makes it so that anyone can distribute any copy/modification to this project.
