# Taking S-8 to another direction

So lately I have been messing around with my dads old commadore 64. And I really liked playing around with it, making my own programs and programming in this relatively simple language. I think it provides this easily accessible escape from the real world as the commadore world is right in front of you.

I think I want to take S-8 in that direction, I want it to be your own little world where you can escape in. I want you to have full control over your system and feel like you progress by every program you make. I want the programs to be savable on permanent storage, and let you have full control over your 64x64 panel.


# Technical details

I think I want a graphical language, not graphical like scratch but with graphical I mean something simple but really cool.

An example would be something like 
```
sprite index x y
----------------
sprite 3 30 23
```

This would just draw a sprite on the screen at the given position, simple but really cool, combined with some variables and some logic you got yourself pong.

I also want the programs to be savable on a disk as you would feel like you are progressing and building up a library of programs.

I know my generations (gen z) isn't really that blown away by coming home and playing some custom made games together on your cool computer. But I still think it's a really cool concept.

There are also some components that I would like to add to S-8 these include:
```
Gpu
Spu (sound processing unit)
Memory card
Game controllers
```

I also would want you to be able to create your own sprites in the system itself, create your own sound and save all of that to the permanent disk!s

# The feel

A special thing about the commadore is that you have that "feel", it's the keyboard it's the feeling of that commadore... I don't know how to explain it but I think we can all agree that going on a commadore in real life is much nicer than going on a commadore emulator.

I want S-8 to have that kindof feeling. I want it to feel like it is it's own system even though it is not, I want it to feel like a commadore in real life but on an emulator.
